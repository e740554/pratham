## About Pratham
Pratham (meaning "first" in Hindi, akin to Protium - Hydrogen's first isotope) is pioneering sustainable hydrogen production using innovative waste-to-value technology. Founded by Ekansh Sharma, Pratham transforms wastewater into ultra-pure water for green hydrogen production in water-scarce regions with high solar potential. "V2V" stands for "Vatten till Vätgas" (Water to Hydrogen in Swedish), reflecting the founder's research background in Sweden.
