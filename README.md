# Pratham Website Form Submission Fix

This directory contains files to fix the form submission issue on the Pratham website. Currently, the forms are set up correctly with Netlify attributes but are not being submitted via AJAX, which would provide a better user experience without page refreshes.

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Add the new form handler JavaScript

Copy the `form-handler.js` file to your project's `js` directory:

```bash
cp form-handler.js /path/to/your/repository/js/
```

### 2. Update your index.html

You don't need to replace your entire index.html file. Instead, make these specific changes:

1. Add the script tag for the new form handler (right before the closing `</body>` tag):

```html
<script src="js/form-handler.js" defer></script>
```

The script tag should be placed after the `main.js` script tag.

### 3. Test the implementation

After making these changes:

1. Deploy your site to Netlify
2. Test both the newsletter and contact forms
3. Verify that the forms submit without page refresh
4. Check that success messages appear correctly

## How It Works

The new implementation:

1. Keeps all your existing form validation logic intact
2. Adds AJAX form submission using the Fetch API
3. Shows appropriate success messages for each form type
4. Includes offline form submission capabilities (works with your Service Worker)
5. Maintains accessibility by updating ARIA live regions

## Troubleshooting

If forms still don't work after implementation:

1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify that all form elements have proper `name` attributes
3. Ensure the hidden `form-name` input matches the `name` attribute on the form
4. Check Netlify's form dashboard to see if submissions are being received

## Additional Notes

- The implementation uses your existing CSS styles for success messages
- Form validation remains the same as in your original implementation
- The contact form will show an inline success message since no redirect URL is specified
- The newsletter form will show the existing success message element
